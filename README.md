Components
App.js
The main component that contains the logic for the calculator and UI. It handles user input, performs calculations, and updates the display.

Key Functions in App.js
handleButtonClick: Updates the input field with the clicked button value.
handleClear: Clears the input and result fields.
handleEquals: Evaluates the expression in the input field and updates the result.
handlePower: Calculates powers of a number.
handleRoot: Calculates roots of a number.
handleXY: Calculates x raised to the power of y.
handleYRootX: Calculates yth root of x.
handleScientific: Performs scientific calculations (e.g., trigonometric functions).
handleConstantE: Inserts Euler's number (e).
handleEE: Enters a number in scientific notation.
toggleSecond: Toggles between primary and secondary functions.
Styling
The calculator is styled to mimic the appearance of a physical scientific calculator, with modern design features such as rounded corners and shadows.

Key Styles in App.css
.calculator: Styles the main calculator container.
